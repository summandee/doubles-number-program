# doubles-number-program
Here is a simple Python program that asks the user to enter a number, doubles that number, and continues to repeat the process until the value is 100 or greater:



In this program:


The user is prompted to enter a number.
The input is converted to a float (assuming the user enters a numeric value).
The double_number function doubles the input number.
The doubled number is printed.
If the doubled number is 100 or greater, the program exits. Otherwise, it continues to prompt the user for input and double the number.
You can run this program in a Python environment to interactively enter numbers and see them doubled until a value of 100 or greater is reached.


********* modify the code to handle negative inputs ******************************

Here is the modified Python program that handles negative inputs as well:


This modified program retains the functionality to handle positive numbers and adds error handling to address any exceptions that may arise when working with negative numbers or other unexpected inputs. It will now be able to process negative inputs and provide the doubled value until reaching a value of 100 or greater.
